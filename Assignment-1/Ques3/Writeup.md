Understanding the Code: The script starts by checking if the directory "Result" exists. If not, it creates the directory. If the directory exists, the script checks if the file "output.txt" exists within it. If it does, the existing file is removed to ensure clean output.
Next, the script reads each line from the "input.txt" file. The line is split using space as a delimiter, and the individual values are assigned to variables a, b, and operation. Based on the operation, the script performs calculations and stores the result in the ans variable. It also constructs a descriptive message, op, indicating the operation and input values.
For each set of inputs, the script appends the op and ans to the "output.txt" file. The loop continues until there are no more lines in the input file.
Conclusion: This Bash script successfully acts as an arithmetic calculator by reading input from "input.txt", performing calculations, and saving the results to "output.txt" in the "Result" directory. The script efficiently handles multiple sets of inputs, and using loops, conditionals, and file operations demonstrates its functionality as a math calculator. This project showcases the power and flexibility of Bash scripting for automating tasks and processing data.
